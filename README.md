**Age 29 / Engineer + Happy Hardcore DJ**

I am a software engineer who is passionate about building high quality systems, tools, and applications.

I am continually striving for the feeling of having built something I’m proud of, something I know that I didn’t take shortcuts on, and something worth sharing. I also have a deep appreciation for modern design aesthetics and robust interaction design. The melding of form and function is my holy grail.
